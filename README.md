# PGM-Causal-Reasoning
Experiments on structure learning of Bayesian Networks with emphasis on finding causal relationship

These experiments are done in context of the course Probabilistic Graphical Models (WiSe 18/19) held by Prof. Kristian Kersting at at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.

## Datasets

_Note: I needed to install a slightly older version for scipy in order to avoid: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9606_
```bash
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xe2'
```
using
```bash
sudo pip2 install scipy==1.1.0
```
